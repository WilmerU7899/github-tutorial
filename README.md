## Git vs. GitHub

> To begin we need to know what Git and Github are.
In a short explanation, Git and Github manage your code and allows you to keep track of different versions.

* **Git**
    * Version control: Keep “snapshots” (record) of your code 
        * Can easily revert one specific   command 
        * Keep a timeline of your code 
    * Most importantly it does not require Github

* **Github**
    * It stores your code in the cloud
    * You can visually track changes
    * Makes it easy to collaborate on files
    * Requires Git

## Initial Setup

## Repository Setup

## Workflow & Commands

`git init` - Initializes git in our directory (now we call it repository) for version control - only do this in the beginning.  
* While using `git init` keep in mind:
    * To do it in the directory you want to turn into repository 
    * **NEVER TO DO IT IN ROOT DIRECTORY**


`git status`  -  Optional command to see what files have been edited sicne the last commit  
`git add`  -  
`git commmit`  -  take a ‘snapshot’ of the files on the stage.  The message should be present-tense and describe what was modified in this snapshot  
`git log`
