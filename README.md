## Git vs. GitHub

> To begin we need to know what Git and Github are.
In a short explanation, Git and Github manage your code and allows you to keep track of different versions.

* **Git**
    * Version control: Keep “snapshots” (record) of your code 
        * Can easily revert one specific   command 
        * Keep a timeline of your code 
    * Most importantly it does not require Github

* **Github**
    * It stores your code in the cloud
    * You can visually track changes
    * Makes it easy to collaborate on files
    * Requires Git
